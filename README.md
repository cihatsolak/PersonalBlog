Basically, in my project that I developed with the aspnetcore structure, I reduced the dependency by making the web api part a separate project. My web project takes action through the api. I plan to add the mobile project in the future. I used concepts such as View Component and Tag Helper that come with the net core. I can say that I also implemented swagger integration for the api part in my project where I give a lot of innovation. I have benefited a lot from the interface, abstract classes and generic structures.
